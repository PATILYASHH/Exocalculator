## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually comes with Node.js)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/exocalculator.git
    cd exocalculator
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    The Currency Calculator requires an API key from [ExchangeRate-API](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/).

    - Create a `.env` file in the root of the project.
    - Add your API key to the `.env` file as follows:
      ```
      VITE_EXCHANGE_RATE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
      ```
    - If you don't have an API key, the currency calculator will use fallback approximate values.
