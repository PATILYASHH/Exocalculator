/**
 * @file Root TypeScript configuration file for the project.
 * @description This is a solution-style tsconfig.json file. It uses references to other tsconfig files
 * in the project to manage different compilation contexts, such as the application source code
 * and the build-related Node.js files (like vite.config.ts).
 *
 * @property {Array} files - An empty array, as this file's purpose is to reference other configs, not to include files directly.
 * @property {Array<object>} references - An array of objects that point to the other tsconfig.json files in the project.
